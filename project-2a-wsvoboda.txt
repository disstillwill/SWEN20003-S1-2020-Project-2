(Associations -0.5) Your Composition and aggregation lines are facing the wrong direction. Bidirectional associations
should have no arrowheads. Abstract methods also need to be italicised. (Class Breakdown -0.5) Main class missing, main
class needs main method. (Method/Attribute Use -0.5) You should include a reference/association to gameobjects in your
shadowdefend as they need to exist in the game world. Note that this  should be done polymorphically. Slicer should not
have a reference to the projectile.
